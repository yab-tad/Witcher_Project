# Witcher_Project
The purpose of this project is to extract relationship among characters in the Witcher book series, and then perform network analysis. To achieve this, the first notebook dubbed Character_Web_Scrapping.ipynb scraps the characters name from all the Witcher books and saves them in relation to which characters are in which book as a .csv file.
