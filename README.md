# Witcher_Project
The purpose of this project is to extract relationship among characters in the Witcher book series, and then perform network analysis. To achieve this, the first notebook, dubbed `Character_Web_Scraping.ipynb`, scraps the characters name from all the Witcher books and saves them in relation to which book they are present in as a `.csv` file.
